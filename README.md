# /userstyles

A collection of home-made UserStyle CSS files, to be used with Stylus or other mechanism. UserStyles are used to modify the appearance (what you see) of a select few websites which I frequently use and would rather have a different design.

Use with the Stylus browser extention (for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/el/firefox/addon/styl-us/), for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)). Be cautious of similar-looking extentions as they’re often used to collect data without your consent. For an intoduction on how to use and experiment with Stylus (no need to be a programmer) see [“Redesign Your Favorite Websites — Stylus Extension for FireFox or Chrome”](https://medium.com/@coffmans/redesign-your-favorite-websites-stylus-extension-for-firefox-or-chrome-c5d5ae68e288).

These UserStyles *[may](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues/39)* update automatically to accomodate for improvements and breaking changes, but they are primarily intented for my personal use, hence I am reluctant to changes that do not serve my interest. You may use the [Issue page](https://github.com/Arty2/userstyles/issues) to report any unintented behaviour (bugs) or breaks (usually when the website implements a major change) that you come accross.
